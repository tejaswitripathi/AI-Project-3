# AI-Project-3

◦ Designed and implemented a 2D convolutional neural network to predict the number of moves remaining for a bot to
locate a target based on current position and probabilistic knowledge base
◦ Achieved a predictive accuracy with an average L1 loss of 3 moves as the bot neared the target
◦ Developed an upgraded bot integrating the tuned model’s predictions into its utility function, resulting in a 7.5% reduction
